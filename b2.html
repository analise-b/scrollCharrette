        My lips reflect off his cross-gold chain
        I like the way he's telling me
        My ass looks good in these ripped blue jeans
        My cheeks are red like cherries in the spring
        Body's a work of art you'd die to see
        Untouched, XO
        Young lust, let's- (ah)
        When we drive in your car, I'm your baby (so sweet)
        Losing all my innocence in the back seat
        Say you love, say you love, say you love me (love me)

        Losing all my innocence in the back seat
        Break all the rules 'til we get caught
        Fog up the windows in the parking lot
        Summer love (ah, ah), sexy
        Sitting on his lap, sippin' Diet Pepsi

        I leave a mark so you know I'm the best

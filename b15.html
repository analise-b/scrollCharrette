    <p class="lyrics">My boys a winner, he loves the game
        My lips reflect off his cross-gold chain
        I like the way he's telling me
        My ass looks good in these ripped blue jeans
        My cheeks are red like cherries in the spring
        Body's a work of art you'd die to see
        Untouched, XO</p>

        My cheeks are red like cherries in the spring
        Body's a work of art you'd die to see
        Untouched, XO</p>
